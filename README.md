# Rcircos-plot

Circos is a package in R programing language addresses  the  following  problem:
 how  does  one  show  information  that  relates  a  pair  of  genome  positions?  Such  relationships  can  include  sequence  similarity  (alignments,  conservation,  synteny),  structural  rearrangements  (gene  fusions,  translocations,  inversions),  or  
co-¬‐‐expression.   This  representation  is  effective  in  revealing  patterns  and  
scales  well  as  the  number  of  curves  increases.    
Circos generates circular visualizations, of genomic and other data

    Circos  implements  various  features  that  help  in  communicating  large  genomic  data  sets,  including  global  and  local  scale  stretching,  axis  breaks  and  formatting  rules  
Circos can adjust the visualization based on data values

    Data  tracks  can  be  associated  with  rules,  which  are  snippets  of  code  which  change  how  data  is  displayed  based  on  its  characteristics  (value,  position,  color,  etc).  These  rules  make  it  possible  to  highlight,  alter  or  hide  information  without  having  to  define  this  formatting  in  the  data  files
